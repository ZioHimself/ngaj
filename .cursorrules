# Cursor AI Agent Rules for ngaj

## ⚠️ Critical: Escalation Guidelines

**All agents MUST follow**: [Escalation Guidelines](.agents/context/escalation-guidelines.md)

**Core Principle**: When in doubt, blocked, or facing conflicts → STOP and ASK HUMAN → Never guess or workaround

Before proceeding with any ambiguous decision, conflicting requirement, or out-of-scope issue, agents must:
1. STOP work immediately
2. Document the issue clearly
3. Present options (if applicable)
4. ASK human for decision
5. WAIT for confirmation before proceeding

## Designer Agent Mode

When I say "design [feature]" or "let's design [feature]":
1. Load system prompt from `.agents/prompts/designer/system-prompt.md`
2. Engage in collaborative dialogue to explore:
   - Problem space and requirements
   - Data models and entity relationships
   - API contracts and interfaces
   - Trade-offs and design options
3. Document decisions (in order, with cross-references):
   - ADR (WHY): Architecture Decision Record in `docs/architecture/decisions/`
   - Design Doc (HOW): Technical specification in `.agents/artifacts/designer/designs/`
   - Handoff (TEST WHAT): Test guidance in `.agents/artifacts/designer/handoffs/`
4. Create type stubs in `src/shared/types/` (if applicable)
5. Ensure no duplication: each document has unique content, linked together

## Test-Writer Agent Mode

When I say "write tests for [requirement]":
1. Load system prompt from `.agents/prompts/test-writer/system-prompt.md`
2. Read requirement from `requirements/features/[requirement].feature`
3. Read design docs from `.agents/artifacts/designer/handoffs/` (if available)
4. Generate test plan in `.agents/artifacts/test-writer/test-plans/`
5. Write tests in `tests/` directory
6. Verify tests fail (Red phase)

## Implementer Agent Mode

When I say "implement [requirement]":
1. Load system prompt from `.agents/prompts/implementer/system-prompt.md`
2. Read failing tests
3. Implement in `src/` directory
4. Run tests to verify they pass (Green phase)

## Reviewer Agent Mode

When I say "review [change]":
1. Load system prompt from `.agents/prompts/reviewer/system-prompt.md`
2. Load checklists from `.agents/prompts/reviewer/checklists/`
3. Review code and tests
4. Generate report in `.agents/artifacts/reviewer/review-reports/`

## Context Loading

Always load:
- [docs](docs/)
- [tech-stack.md](docs/tech-stack.md)
- [project-glossary.md](docs/project-glossary.md)

## Workflows

**Full Cycle** (for new features):
1. Designer → Design docs + ADR
2. Test-Writer → Failing tests
3. Implementer → Passing implementation
4. Reviewer → Review report

**TDD Cycle** (for small changes or when design exists):
1. Test-Writer → Failing tests
2. Implementer → Passing implementation
3. Reviewer → Review report
